"""
Contains the Bayes optimization class.
Initialization parameters:
    model: an object with methods 'predict', 'fit', and 'update'
    interface: an object which supplies the state of the system and
        allows for changing the system's x-value.
        Should have methods '(x,y) = intfc.getState()' and 'intfc.setX(x_new)'.
        Note that this interface system is rough, and used for testing and
            as a placeholder for the machine interface.
    acq_func: specifies how the optimizer should choose its next point.
        'EI': uses expected improvement. The interface should supply y-values.
        'testEI': uses EI over a finite set of points. This set must be
            provided as alt_param, and the interface need not supply
            meaningful y-values.
    xi: exploration parameter suggested in some Bayesian opt. literature
    alt_param: currently only used when acq_func=='testEI'
    m: the maximum size of model; can be ignored unless passing an untrained
        SPGP or other model which doesn't already know its own size
    bounds: a tuple of (min,max) tuples specifying search bounds for each
        input dimension. Generally leads to better performance.
        Has a different interpretation when iter_bounds is True.
    iter_bounds: if True, bounds the distance that can be moved in a single
        iteration in terms of the length scale in each dimension. Uses the
        bounds variable as a multiple of the length scales, so bounds==2
        with iter_bounds==True limits movement per iteration to two length
        scales in each dimension. Generally a good idea for safety, etc.
    prior_data: input data to train the model on initially. For convenience,
        since the model can be trained externally as well.
        Assumed to be a pandas DataFrame of shape (n, dim+1) where the last
            column contains y-values.

Methods:
    acquire(): Returns the point that maximizes the acquisition function.
        For 'testEI', returns the index of the point instead.
        For normal acquisition, currently uses the bounded L-BFGS optimizer.
            Haven't tested alternatives much.
    best_seen(): Uses the model to make predictions at every observed point,
        returning the best-performing (x,y) pair. This is more robust to noise
        than returning the best observation, but could be replaced by other,
        faster methods.
    OptIter(): The main method for Bayesian optimization. Maximizes the
        acquisition function, then uses the interface to test this point and
        update the model.
